## Custom Development Builds

For advanced native features, you'll need to create a Custom Development Build instead of using Expo Go.

### **When do you need a Custom Development Build?**

- **Native Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In, Google Sign In
- **In-App Purchases**: App Store and Google Play subscriptions
- **Advanced Native Features**: Third-party SDKs, platform-specifc features (e.g. Widgets on iOS)
- **Background Processing**: Background tasks, location tracking

### **Creating a Custom Development Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

For web deployments, you can use custom domains with:

- **EAS Hosting** - Custom domains available on paid plans
- **Netlify** - Free custom domain support
- **Vercel** - Custom domains with automatic SSL

For mobile apps, you'll configure your app's deep linking scheme in `app.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### **App not loading on device?**

1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Try using tunnel mode: `bun start -- --tunnel`
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
